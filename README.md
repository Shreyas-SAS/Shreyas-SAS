_**<🤔 Whoami**_

I am a Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) student at Indian Institute of Technology, Bhubaneswar (IIT BBS) scheduled to graduate in 2024. <br>

Apart from general college life therotical subjects to pass my exams 😅 I like to explore different fields of Technology, <br>
I am an Aspiring learner in **Web Development** and **Machine Learning** (particularly **Data Science**) with interest towards Competitive Programming , Cyber Security and Game Development.<br> 

I wish to refrain from the other too exciting looking things like Blockchain and Smart contracts, AR/VR, and all the fancy stuff for now because i know i will be swayed away real quick. You can say this is my weekness. 😅 <br>

I Would really love top collaborate with you no matter how small the project is...☺
